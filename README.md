# Introduction

This is one of the projects I am most proud of. It is a fully functioning parking spot locator website, named Parka. I developed all aspects of this project using CSS, HTML, JavaScript and SQL databases. The project was then hosted live with AWS (Amazon Web Services). This website was developed as part of a multi-stage project for a course solely focusing on Website Design & Interfacin and throughout this course I got an excellent chance to become well acquainted with all of the previously mentioned means of development. 

## About The Project

The point of the project was to develop a website that assists users with finding a parking spot or owners with uploading a parking spot. Users could search with various different input and the appropriate results (from what was stored in the SQL database) would return. I also embedded the Google Maps API within my website in order to show the results on a live map. I used HTML and CSS to ensure the pages look aesthetically pleasing as well as using JavaScript and som native HTML for the algorithms used for returning results and ensuring information was passed appropriately. The website was also connected to an SQL database which housed all the parking spaces and information needed to find them when users searched. It should also be noted that the website was made such that it functioned perfectly with all forms of media (phone, tablet or computer).

## Files

In order to access the file for this project please click "View on GitHub".

However, these files are all the local files and hence will not have the same effect as when they were all hosted live through AWS. Hence I have included some pictures above to give an accurate representation as to the look and feel of the website.

If you would like to know more about the code or any other part of this project please feel free to ask me questions at: **elijahwilding@gmail.com**.
